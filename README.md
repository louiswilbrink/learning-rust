# Learning Rust

This repo contains all of the example code in the Rust Book, written and executed by myself in the endeavor to learn Rust.

This repo also contains a copy of the Rustlings exercise book, also completed in the endeavor to learn Rust.

The `syntax_examples` crate contains a binary file that shows an example of every core syntax of the Rust language.
